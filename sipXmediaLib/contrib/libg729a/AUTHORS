This G729 library was forked from https://github.com/ploverlake/g729a
Which was modified by Russle Ploverlake to refactor the static variables from
the ITU implementation, into structures to support multiple encode and decode
streams at the same time.

Porting to sipX supported linux distributions by Dan Petrie
